# OPZ_Bounce_Puller
This is a tool designed to automate the process of transferring .wav bounce files from a Teenage Engineering OPZ synth to a user-defined folder on your computer. It also offers options to delete the files from the OPZ after transfer. This program saves time by streamlining what would otherwise be a multi-step, manual file management task.
